Sooo here's what we have...

Test::Kit + Test::Aggregate is totally broken

Test::Kit + Test::Aggregate::Nested seems to work if you only use Test::More,
but not if you try to put Test::Exception or similar into the mix. Seems to be
because the lives_ok() subroutine isn't exported into all the necessary
packages?

Please help! :-(
